## IliyanK

- [] Bug: When the user enteres chats continously, the messages are messed up and showing the wrong
  set of messages
- [] Bug: the attachment images are dissapearing and then popping up again
- [] Bug: when more then 1 simultaneous connections are made, the second device can authenticate
  with the user credentials of the first device, even with wrong credentials (because after log out
  the server doesn't kill the socket connection ?)
- [] Bug: Change password is not working
- [] Feature: Remove the unique groupChat name constraint
- [] Feature: Add a functionality on group chat, where you're unable to remove yourself from the
  group chat, if you're the last person in the group chat
